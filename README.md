# caeser-cipher
This is a simple nodejs web application that uses a caeser cipher module to encrypt or decrypt text. This was a small part of a larger project I submitted during my final university year. 
Modules used: 
  express
  body-parser
  caesar-crypt
How to use:
  run npm install
  start script: nodemon app.js
  The app will run in localhost 3000. Simply enter your text and choose either encrypt or decrypt and GO!.
